%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
 \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
 \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my/url/here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

We present a viable, novel approach to detect inference attacks on cryptographic protocols using symbolic verification. The approach consists of including an auxiliary population and inference rules in formal models of cryptographic protocols. This preliminary work forms the basis for extending the utility of symbolic verification to a wider range of attack scenarios. The case studies in this paper demonstrate the utility of the approach as a tool for understanding inference attacks on Property Preserving Encryption.

\section{Introduction}
% ( ?/2000 words) 
In response to numerous breeches\cite{StateOfIS} of computer systems the use of encryption technique in the storage of data has increased\cite{Raghavendra2016}. Poor design and poor implementation of these techniques has let to false confidence in their effectiveness and additional breech's of trust (e.g. \cite{NewSouthWales}) .
Numerous tools and techniques have been developed to improve the state of the  art and the correct application of them has been used to strengthen the security of systems and data\cite{SOK2017}.  
Symbolic Verification is a proven(\cite{Meier2013, 5GAKA, 18XOR}) technique for detecting potential attack scenarios and other weaknesses in cryptographic protocols.
Briefly, in symbolical modelling of cryptographic protocols messages are represented as terms in a term algebra. As implemented in the automated prover \tamarin{}\cite{Meyer2012} (used in this work); the protocol and actions are modelled by multiset rewriting rules that define transition between states. Security properties are defined by propositional statements about the logged traces of the those transitions. The solver uses a backwards search approach to prove or falsify those properties. 
This paper presents an approach to extend symbolic modelling techniques(\cite{Meier2013, ObsEqvCCS15}) to detect inference based attacks by modelling auxiliary population histograms and inference based reveal techniques that compare these histograms to those of an encrypted dataset.
\subsection{Motivation}
%(?/500 words)}
This work explores initial directions in how automatic symbolical verification can be extended to detect potential inference attacks in cryptographic protocols, in particular, Property Preserving Encryption protocols.
The practical application of cryptographic protocols can be viewed as an efficiency/privacy trade-off\cite{GenericAttacks}, where efficiency is a product of functionality and performance. Property Preserving Encryption and other encrypted search techniques\cite{SOK2017} are an area of research that seeks to find the appropriate balance between these three competing concerns.   

One technique, Deterministic Encryption (DET) i.e an encryption that always produces the same encrypted text for a given plain-text, forms part of many cryptographically protected database search systems\cite{SOK2017} such as CryptDB \cite{Popa2011}, CipherBase \cite{cipherbase}, Microsoft's Always Encrypted mode in SQLServer\cite{AlwaysEncrypted}, Google's Big Query\cite{BigQuery} and Bellare \cite{Bellare2007}. As a technique DET is useful as it preserving the equality relationships permitting efficient searching and facilitating data relationships in search queries. Though DET encryption is a useful construct for building encrypted databases as it performs well, does not suffer from significant message expansion, and  permits searching it's know to leak equality information \cite{SOK2017} and with a suitable auxiliary dataset the individual values are recoverable via inference\cite{InfrenceAttacks} . 

Inference attacks are one of the  oldest\cite{Arab} cryptographic attack models. For exposition, consider a simple letter substitution cipher (Caesar's cipher) where 'D' replaces every 'A', 'E' replaces every 'B' etc. An attacker can generate a letter frequency histogram from an auxiliary dataset such as previous messages or even a general language corpus. For the English language message the attacker could assume that the most used letter in the enciphered message corresponds to the letter 'E'. The attacker can continue in this manner using individual letter frequency or include more sophisticate analysis of two-letter frequencies for example.

The real-world effectiveness of inference attacks depends on the availability of a well-correlated auxiliary dataset. Work\cite{Ismal2012} on the design of inference attacks  shows that it is possible to recover information about encrypted datasets and queries from data leakage combined with auxiliary datasets such as statistical census data. Work in \cite{InfrenceAttacks} shows that information can be recovered for data encrypted with DET and Order Preserving Encryption (OPE) with a high degree of accuracy; 60\%+ for DET and 80\%+ for OPE in certain cases.

The number of possible values in a dataset affects the success of such attacks. For example the recovery rate of the patients \textit{ Age} was only 10\% in 83\% of the hospitals \cite{InfrenceAttacks}; this was due to the large number of values and multiple values having similar frequencies in the histograms.

The security of such a system, then, relies on the \textit{absence} of a strongly correlated auxiliary dataset and on the size and distribution of the values. 
As proving such a auxiliary dataset does not exist is likely impossible or at the very least impractical to know at design time, detecting that a system is vulnerable in the presence of particular auxiliary dataset motivates the remediation or replacement of such a system.
Symbolic Verification is an established and proven technique for identifying problems with protocols and this work extends the class of problems that can be detected and provides a tool to quantify to what extent systems are vulnerable.


\subsection{Threat Model}
This paper considers a threat model where an adversary has access to an encrypted data set (legitimately as in an honest-but-curious security model or illegitimately in a breech scenario). 
The attacker also has access to an auxiliary dataset that is structured in the same manner as the encrypted dataset i.e. same data-types and number of distinct values. This auxiliary dataset could be in the form of a publicly available dataset or it could be the result of a side-channel attack \cite{Kocher96}. Examples of side channel attacks that might generate suitable auxiliary data include timing analysis attacks, power analysis attacks and traffic analysis attacks\cite{SideChannelSurvey}.
The goal of the adversary is to retrieve \textit{all} values in the unencrypted dataset; either because it is of direct value to them or it can be used as an additional Auxiliary dataset to attack another encrypted dataset. 
The attack is based on the attacker using that the frequency distribution of a column is similar to that of the population and concluding with some degree of confidence what the  given encrypted value is. 

The \textit{quality} of an auxiliary dataset is application-dependant\cite{InfrenceAttacks}; an auxiliary dataset that is strongly correlated with the target data can give an attacker good results but may not be available to an attacker.

\subsection{Contribution}
We present a symbolic validation(using \tamarin{}) technique for encryption protocols in the face of inference attacks after \cite{InfrenceAttacks}. \textbf{1.} This approach consists of a method to inject auxiliary population data and associated histograms in to a symbolic verification model. \textbf{2.} The approach uses an \textit{Inference} rule that models the reveals of encrypted data when it can be inferred from comparing the histograms of the modelled encrypted dataset to the auxiliary population. \textbf{3.} We present a number of initial case studies applying the technique.
This technique can be used as a basis for research into attacking other protocols.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Symbolic Verification with \tamarin{}}
\tamarin{}\cite{Meier2013} is an automated symbolic verification tool for analysing cryptographic protocols. \tamarin{} allows for the modelling of complex security properties, cryptographic primitives and state. It is an open-source\cite{TamarinGithub} (GPL 3.0 Licensed), actively maintained project with a rich community of contributors. The project is also a rich repository of models used in previous publications including analysis of the 5G AKA protocol\cite{5GAKA}, the DPN3  Power grid protocol\cite{DNP3} and Alethea\cite{Alethea} a secure voting system.

\subsection{Observational Equivalence}
If two systems appear the same to the outside environment they are set to be \textit{Observational Equivalent}.
This definition can be used to specify properties of a protocol and also in verification of models and implementations. 
\cite{ObsEqvCCS15} demonstrates a definition of Observational Equivalence and uses \tamarin{} with a number of case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach for proving security properties on protocols with mutable state and unbounded numbers of sessions. \tamarin{} \cite{Schmidt2012AutomatedProperties} prover is a widely used\cite{ARPKICCS14, Donenfeld} tool for symbolic verification in general and numerous case studies\cite{Norwegian,5GAKA} validate the utility of the Observational equivalence approach.

The automate proof uses a \textit{bi-system} approach. This approach is a multiset rewriting system with a \textit{diff} operator \cite{AutomatedObsEqv18}.  A system modeller can specify two similar systems, denoted left and right, which differ in some terms, with the goal of the automated proved prove that left and right are Observational Equivalent, i.e an attacker can not determine the difference between the two systems.
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Implementing Inference Attack in a Symbolical Model with \tamarin{}}
%\todo[inline]{1500 words}
The attacker has access to an encrypted dataset \enc{} over the message space \encSpace{} and plaintext auxiliary dataset \aux{} over the message space \auxSpace. Using a frequency analysis approach similar to the one described in \cite{InfrenceAttacks} an attacker will assign plaintext values to each of the encrypted values by rank ordering the dataset histograms. i.e the most common value in \enc{}\ is declared to be the most common value in \aux{} etc.

Models are encoded into state transition \texttt{rules} that model how the protocol proceeds from state to state. The model contains a single shared state for all parties in the protocol and as the protocol is executed \texttt{traces} are recorded of the states and transitions used. Security properties (Secrecy, Uniqueness etc) and execution properties (A must happen before B etc) are enforced via \texttt{lemmas}. Violation of lemmas leads to a proof being falsified.

When run in Observational Equivalence mode two versions of the same protocol system are evaluated with an additional set of Equivalence lemmas that verify if the two versions appear the same to an outside observer.

Figure \ref{fig:approach} provides a general schematic of the relationship between the key elements of the approach used.

 By convention the \textbf{Right Hand System (RHS)} is the secure system while the \textbf{Left Hand System (LHS)} is the system that will be varied under test. Both systems contain the following elements:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item \textbf{Protocol Model} The protocol is modelled with \tamarin{} state transition rules. \tamarin{} uses these state transition rules to move between states. The models of the protocols under test contain \textbf{Modify Rules} that modify the encrypted dataset (i.e. insert new values). Both LHS and RHS have identical modification rules.
\item \textbf{Security and Execution} properties are encoded in the form of \texttt{lemmas} in both systems. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \LSecurity{Confidentiality}: the adversary never knows the encrypted values \enc{}. If this lemma is violated the proof fails.
    \item \LExecution{Encryption and Decryption}: Lemma to ensure that has the protocol executed correctly. (A protocol that never executes remains secure and can give false positive results).
	\item \LExecution{Growth}: The dataset of encrypted values \enc{} grows correctly as new values are added and that the set of counters increments correctly as the population grows; these counters model the distribution in the protected data.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{The Auxiliary dataset \aux{} over \auxSpace}:
In the RHS the Auxiliary dataset \auxsecure{} is an evenly distributed un-encrpted population.  The auxiliary population and its histogram data is encoded into the model using \tamarin{} multi-sets as \tamarin{} currently has no direct support for counters. 
In the LHS the distribution of the auxiliary population is varied and injected (along with the distribution histograms) in to the model using a script external to \tamarin{}.
An example of how this the auxiliary dataset and histograms are modelled is included in Listing \ref{lst:CreateAuxDatasetRule}.
\item\textbf{ Inference Based Reveal Rule}. This is the key element of this approach, it encodes the "intuitive leap" required to connect the distribution of the auxiliary population with the encrypted dataset.   If  distribution of \aux{} matches \enc{} the rule will reveal the plaintext value. The rule is the same in the LHS and RHS. An example of how this is modelled is included in Listing \ref{lst:InferRule}.
\item \textbf{Execution}
The \tamarin{} prover is executed with each of generated \aux{} populations in \textbf{Observational Equivalence} mode. The prover can vary the target encrypted dataset distribution by inserting encrypted values using the modification rules. If the prover can not distinguish between the LHS and RHS then we conclude that the protocol is secure for that auxiliary population distribution.  In the case of an evenly distributed auxiliary dataset the there is nothing to infer from regardless of the distribution of the target dataset. In the case of a non-evenly distributed auxiliary datasets the attacker can attack a target dataset with the same distribution. Each permutation of the auxiliary dataset is compared with the evenly distributed dataset in this manner. If the two systems analysis are observational equivalence an attacker can not reason about the differences and Tamarin can prove that an adversary can not distinguish between the two systems and we can prove that the data is secure in the presence of such an auxiliary dataset.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Case Studies on applying technique}
\subsection{Attacking 2-value Deterministic Encryption}
Deterministic Encryption (DET) always encodes the same value the same way. It is well known that it is vulnerable to frequency analysis ( a technique used since the 9th century\cite{Arab} for breaking classical encryption techniques including DET). As mentioned above DET is a widely used construct in encrypted database systems. We consider a DET encrypted database column representing the sex of patients who stayed at a hospital; a simple histogram of the two possible values might show a 55\%/45\% split. An attacker could infer that the 55\% represents females as auxiliary datasets show more of the patients will be female\cite{InfrenceAttacks} than male. This fact can then be leveraged to infer other attributes; i.e certain disease types affect females more than males; more males are born that females and females have a longer life expectancy. These publicly available statistics are an auxiliary dataset that an attacker can freely use. 

This protocol is modelled and attacked as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
        \item A. The DET/2 protocol is encode as two pairs of equations which are used by the \textbf{Modify Rules}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 	$DET_{encrypt}(1) -> X,\quad	DET_{encrypt}(0) -> Y$
    	\item 	$DET_{decrypt}(X) ->  1,\quad   DET_{decrypt}(Y) ->  0$
        
    \end{enumerate}
    The actual X and Y values are determined by the setup phase and do not affect the proof.
	When a value is stored using the $DET_{encrypt}$ equation the appropriate histogram counters are also incremented. Multi-sets are used as a base-1 counter (i.e $'X'+'X'+'X'+'X'+'X' = 5$).  This approach increments the counters as data is inserted and was found to be significantly faster than the alternative approach of counting on demand with additional counters and rules.
\item The \aux{} population is encoded as un-ordered multi-sets (e.g $ 1' + '1' ... ' + '0' + '0'$) and the \aux{} histogram counters are injected as base-1 multi-sets as above. 
\item The inference rule reveals the encrypted values of X and Y if the auxiliary population distribution uniquely matches the encrypted dataset population.
\item The prover will execute each model twice, if it can not distinguish between the two cases (50/50 and the one under test) then the proof is valid. The population is varied as follows: 0/10\%, 10/90\% ..., 90/10\%, 100/0\%. 
Using the built in Observational Equivalence function diff(); Tamarin attempts to prove each model twice, once with the Aux population and once with a perfectly distributed set of values (i.e. 50/50\%). 
\item As a control the experiment is repeated using non-deterministic Random encryption with the expectation that the data is secure regardless of population distribution. This is discussed below.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Results} As intuitively expected only the protocol is only proved secure in the presence of a 50/50 auxiliary distribution. All other auxiliary distributions allow the symbolic verified to find an attack scenario via inference. The elapsed run time of the verification on commodity hardware was not significant. These findings are an important validation of validity and practicality of the approach.

\subsection{Attacking 2-value Random Encryption}
As a control for the above case we also modelled a similar protocol replacing the DET equations with non-deterministic encryption.
This mode of encryption does not allow for searching and is not classed as Property Preserving. This is modelled by the RND equation below. This form of encryption is typically implemented by including a fresh random value in the encryption and as a side effect this technique causes message expansion. This random value is discarded on decryption. A RND encryption function is used in \cite{Popa2011} and other systems as a secure but unsearchable encryption option.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $RND_{decrypt}(key, RND_{encrypt}(key, m))=m$
\end{enumerate}
The execution method was identical to that used in the DET case above.\\
\textbf{Results} As expected the prover was not able to find an inference attack in any auxiliary population scenario. As with the previous case study the automated proofs did not take a significant about of time to run.

\subsection{Attacking Hash functions}
A similar model for attacking hash functions the built-in equations theory for hashing was also constructed similarly. The equation theory models a generic single argument irreversible hash function such as SHA. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $HASH(m) -> h$
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Results} The results were similar to the DET case with only the even distribution of values being provable secure. Although not developed, the addition of a random salt (as used in bcrypt hashing method) would likely yield results similar to the RND case. 
% \todo[inline]{TODO Pretty trivial to rerun over a bunch of different hash functions which will be insecure. Little bit more to implement Hash + salt which will be secure.  Hashing is a form of DET and is commonly used. When used with out proper salt its vulnerable. (Could model this handily and find references to examples where it is not salted correctly and breached) }


\subsection{Generalisation - Attacking DET without external Auxiliary data}
We ran models to confirm that the inference rule can generalise and find attacks without the presence of an specified auxiliary population. By removing the externally generated auxiliary population and adding a second set of \texttt{Modify Rules} that allow the prover to generate both the target dataset and the auxiliary dataset. This approach is based on having the prover find a combination of encrypted data and auxiliary data that leads to data being revealed via the inference rule. This approach is useful for to find that a protocol \textit{is} insecure but it does not help enumerate the conditions under which the inference is a allows an attacker to reveal data. This approach may be particularly useful for finding attacks where the auxiliary data is a by-product of the  protocol execution, i.e side channel attacks.

\section{Future Work}
The technique can currently be applied to a broader range of protocol, potentially yielding new attack models. Future work areas include generalising this technique and exploring adding inference rules automatically to existing symbolic models to extend the applicability of the technique. Currently the infer rule use an exact match, the rule could be extended to have reveal within a specified confidence level of a match. The observational equivalent mode of \tamarin{} could be extended to support multiple auxiliary populations and remove the need for external tooling.

\section{Conclusion}
This novel approach of injecting an auxiliary population and inference rule into a symbolic verification model has proved feasible for some scenarios and is a promising basis for the analysis of other encryption protocols.	Symbolical verification with \tamarin{} is a useful technique for analysing a broad range of protocols and the approach presented here can be used to to augment analysis to detect possible inference based vulnerabilities. The use of an external auxiliary populations proves useful to highlight specific situations where inference attacks are possible and to inform design decisions about the appropriate use of those protocols.
